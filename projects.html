            <p>In November 2019, my friend Anthony Ho and I enrolled in a project course that revolved around implementing modern techniques
                (computer vision and machine learning) in a simulated competition.
            </p>
            <p>The competition takes place in a simulated parking lot environment. This parking lot has 2 loops, and inner and an outer loop, 
                2 crosswalks with pedestrians crossing at any given time, and a truck driving around the inner loop. 
            </p>    
            <p>The objective of the 
                competition is to control a robot that goes around this simulated parking lot, and checks if the parked cars have permission 
                to park by reporting all the license plates and spot numbers of the cars. The robot is to do this without hitting the pedestrians
                or the truck and staying within the lanes, failure to do any of these resulted in point deduction.

            <p>Hedwig is an autonomous robot that was made to compete in the annual 2nd year Engineering Physics robot competition at UBC.
                    The goal of the competition was to create a completely autonomous robot, that was able to navigate a course to
                    precisely pick up stones off of pillars of different heights and place them into a tray.

                <h4>Hedwig went undefeated in competition!</h4>

                <p>Hedwig performed exceptionally in the competition. Although, we won every battle, Hedwig was not promoted to the finals
                    by the judges desicion. However, after the finals, we were given a chance to fight for second, and Hedwig did not let down!

                    Below is a video of the second round of the round robin. Although being the second round, this was the first point
                    scored in the competition.
