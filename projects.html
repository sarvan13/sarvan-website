            <p>Hedwig is an autonomous robot that was made to compete in the annual 2nd year Engineering Physics robot competition at UBC.
                    The goal of the competition was to create a completely autonomous robot, that was able to navigate a course to
                    precisely pick up stones off of pillars of different heights and place them into a tray.

                <h4>Hedwig went undefeated in competition!</h4>

                <p>Hedwig performed exceptionally in the competition. Although, we won every battle, Hedwig was not promoted to the finals
                    by the judges desicion. However, after the finals, we were given a chance to fight for second, and Hedwig did not let down!

                    Below is a video of the second round of the round robin. Although being the second round, this was the first point
                    scored in the competition.
